Pseudocode example for CitiBike Lesson
Goal is to Design an Algorithm that will collect the difference between two values. 

I think what I need is to write something that is going to return the absolute value between the
current value and the value directly preceding (or following, depending on ...?). That would
just give 61 instances of a difference, then how would I summarize those in a way that's meaningful?

I guess if we took the absolute value of each difference between current and following value, 
then we could sum the units to obtain a score, since activity was determined by bikes in + 
bikes out. So if the data looked like this:

Minute 0	7
Minute 1	5
Minute 2	6
Minute 3	2
Minute 4	2
Minute 5	7

Would return:

Minute 0	. (would return nothing since this is the baseline)
Minute 1	2
Minute 2	1
Minute 3	4
Minute 4	0
Minute 5	5

Sum			12 = Activity
